    <h5>About Chill Mode</h5>
    <p>First thing's first... Who are we? Summed up: We are a chill group of adults who enjoy killing pixels at an efficient pace without taking ourselves too seriously.&nbsp; We plan to clear content as we see fit and as our capabilities reach that level.&nbsp; We live by a few simple guidelines, the number one being that we will always do what is best for the guild, in any situation.&nbsp; If you ask yourself that question often, you'll do amazing here.<br><br>Our goal is to make a non-judgmental, fun place to hang out for casual players, boxers, raiders, and any other label you can put on someone.&nbsp; We pride ourselves in doing things simply... no drama, no need.</p>

    <h6>What kind of people is Chill Mode looking to recruit?</h6>
    <p>We highly value all our members, even those who do not raid with us.&nbsp; This guild is a HOME, and we take pride in that.&nbsp; We want players who wish to develop friendships and invest themselves in the guild, while still smashing bosses at a reasonable pace.</p>

    <h6>Loot</h6>
    <p>Loot is DKP based, silent DKP bidding.</p>

    <h6>Communication</h6>
    <p>We use Discord for voice communication during raids and it is mandatory.&nbsp; You do not need a microphone, you only need to be able to hear raid instructions.</p>
    <p>We utilize Discord text channels for non raid communication and guild information.</p>

    <h6>Do you have to raid to be a part of the family?</h6>
    <p>Absolutely not!&nbsp; We pride ourselves on being a good place for good people to hang out at.&nbsp; No drama, no stress... kinda "Chill", I would say.</p>
